# Frida’s Mountain Cottage

Type: Location
Associated: Frida, Aphrodite
Tone: Warm, modest, introspective
Sensory Anchor: Pine resin, woodsmoke, wind in high branches

### Description

A small stone-and-timber cottage set high on a mountain ridge, half-sheltered by pines. Old, repaired often, and quietly lived in.

The town lies an hour’s walk below—close enough to reach, far enough to forget.

### Notes

Central hearth burns daily; one floorboard creaks near it where Frida steps most often

Furniture is mismatched but maintained; nothing is decorative without purpose

An outdoor shower stands near the stream, used regularly despite the cold

A single velvet pillow rests among otherwise plain linens in Aphrodite’s room

### Usage Notes (for AI)

Best used for quiet scenes, reflection, rest, or recovery

Appears most naturally at dusk, night, or early morning

The cottage does not react or speak; it endures

Details should surface slowly, never all at once
